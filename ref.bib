Forward+ is an extension to traditional forward rendering. Light culling, implemented using the compute capability of the GPU, is added to the pipeline to create lists of lights; that list is passed to the final rendering shader, which can access all information about the lights. Although Forward+ increases workload to the final shader, it theoretically requires less memory traffic compared to compute-based deferred lighting. Furthermore, it removes the major drawback of deferred techniques, which is a restriction of materials and lighting models. Experiments are performed to compare the performance of Forward+ and deferred lighting.},

  abstract = {Volume rendering under complex, dynamic lighting is challenging, especially if targeting real-time. To address this challenge, we extend a recent direct illumination sampling technique, spatiotemporal reservoir resampling, to multi-dimensional path space for volumetric media.             By fully evaluating just a single path sample per pixel, our volumetric path tracer shows unprecedented convergence. To achieve this, we properly estimate the chosen sample's probability via approximate perfect importance sampling with spatiotemporal resampling. A key observation is recognizing that applying cheaper, biased techniques to approximate scattering along candidate paths (during resampling) does not add bias when shading. This allows us to combine transmittance evaluation techniques: cheap approximations where evaluations must occur many times for reuse, and unbiased methods for final, per-pixel evaluation.             With this reformulation, we achieve low-noise, interactive volumetric path tracing with arbitrary dynamic lighting, including volumetric emission, and maintain interactive performance even on high-resolution volumes. When paired with denoising, our low-noise sampling helps preserve smaller-scale volumetric details.},

  abstract = {Latency or system response time (i.e., the delay between user input and system response) is a fundamental factor affecting human-computer interaction (HCI). If latency exceeds a critical threshold, user performance and experience get impaired. Therefore, several design guidelines giving recommendations on maximum latencies for an optimal user experience have been developed within the last five centuries. Concentrating on the lower boundary latencies, these guidelines are critically reviewed and contrasted with recent empirical findings. Results of the review reveal that latencies below 100 ms were seldom considered in guidelines so far even though smaller latencies have been shown to be perceivable to the user and impact user performance negatively. Thus, empirical evidence suggests a need for updated guidelines for designing latency in HCI.},
